UtopiaEngine
================

This a port of this [boardgame](ttp://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/75223/utopia-engine), done with permission from the game creator, Nick Hayes.

It's a good game, with nice mechanics, and full of atmosphere.

My main goal is to create a a cross-platform mobile game, using [Xamarin](https://xamarin.com/) and the [MVVMCross framework](https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross) 

Current state
=============
- the game engine is done, and most of it is covered by unit tests
- there is a console UI, using the game engine where you can play a full game.
- I started an Android and a WPF UI project, but designing a good UI is not my strong point, so, I'm real slow.

Future Plans
============
- Finish the WPF UI
- doing a mobile UI
